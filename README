Yahoo! Merchant Solutions Image Downloader

This will attempt to turn all product images in your Yahoo! Merchant Solutions store into a zip archive. The files will be named itemid-fieldname.gif. 

Requirments:
- catalog.xml enabled
- OS X or another Unix-like environment where we can make system() calls to zip.

I haven't test this on Windows (with or without Cygwin). If this doesn't work for whatever reason, I encourage you to begin to panic.

Usage: dl.rb -s your_store_id
