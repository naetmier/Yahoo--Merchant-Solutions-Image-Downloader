Yahoo! Merchant Solutions Image Download

This commandline ruby script will attempt to download your catalog.xml file, grab all the images contained within, rename them to match your Item IDs, and finally zip them. 

This obviously requires your catalog.xml be enabled. This will not work for Yahoo! Stores.
